# Random Walk Visualization
A random walk is a path that’s determined by a series of simple decisions, 
each of which is left entirely to chance.

# Practical Uses
Random walks have practical applications in nature, physics, biology,
chemistry, and economics. For example, a pollen grain floating on a drop
of water moves across the surface of the water because it’s constantly pushed
around by water molecules. Molecular motion in a water drop is random,
so the path a pollen grain traces on the surface is a random walk.
